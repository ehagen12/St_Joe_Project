This is a report to analyze global health and GDP data

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
gap.data.in <- read.delim("output//combined_gapMinder.tsv", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
```

First we'll do some summary of the data
```{r}
summary(gap.data.in)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
